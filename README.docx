Key Features Implemented (Implemented both extra credit features):
•	Server is multithreaded and synchronized to serve multiple pairs of clients at the same time.
•	On the server you can see the http response for the sent message with the correct sender id and message with status code.
•	Multiple pair of clients can chat at the same time in separate chatrooms.
•	Also implemented the extra feature of keeping the database of all the users who are online.
